ochDownloader is a Python based download manager and accelerator.

> **Note:** this branch is under heavy development.
>
> Main goals:
> * Complete all unit testing.
> * Develop a minimum viable product (MVP).
> * Focus on developing the core as a framework for plugins and addons.
> * Reduce code complexity.
>
> Most code here was written in a private branch and is broken/untestted,
> I'll probably create another branch to clean up all the mess and then merge it.
